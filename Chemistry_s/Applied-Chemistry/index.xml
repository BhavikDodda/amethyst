Sludge and Scale formation # On continuous evaporation on hard water in boilers, the salts present in it get saturated and are finally deposited in the areas where the flow is slow.
Sludge: When these precipitates are loose and slimy in nature. Can be removed by scrapping with a brush Disadvantages Poor heat conduction Efficiency Difficult to remove if trapped with a scale Clogging Scale: When they are hard and they adhere strongly to the inner surface Disadvantages Poor heat transfer Overheating of boiler and development of high pressure.</description></item><item><title>Calorimetry</title><link>https://bhavikdodda.github.io/amethyst/Chemistry_s/Applied-Chemistry/Instrumental-techniques/Calorimetry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bhavikdodda.github.io/amethyst/Chemistry_s/Applied-Chemistry/Instrumental-techniques/Calorimetry/</guid><description>Beer&amp;rsquo;s law: It states that the amount of light absorbed by a substance is directly proportional to the concentration of solution.  It states that when a monochromatic beam of radiation passes through the light absorbing medium the rate of decrease of intensity of light with respect to the thickness of the medium is directly proportional to the no. density of the light absorbing medium $$-\frac{dI}{dx}\propto c$$ Lambert&amp;rsquo;s law: It states that the amount of light absorbed by a substance is directly proportional to the path length.</description></item><item><title>Chemical Analysis of Water</title><link>https://bhavikdodda.github.io/amethyst/Chemistry_s/Applied-Chemistry/Water-Treatment/Chemical-Analysis-of-Water/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bhavikdodda.github.io/amethyst/Chemistry_s/Applied-Chemistry/Water-Treatment/Chemical-Analysis-of-Water/</guid><description>Estimation of free chlorine # Alkalinity # Alkalinity is present due to OH⁻, CO₃⁻², HCO₃⁻  OH⁻ and HCO₃⁻ do not exist together  If one is present the other can&amp;rsquo;t be: OH⁻+HCO₃⁻=CO₃²⁻+H₂O OH⁻  CO₃²⁻ [these two consist of P, for Phenolphthalein indicator]  HCO₃⁻ [the above three consist of M, for Methyl orange indicator]  Reactions: OH⁻+H⁺ → H₂O CO₃²⁻+H⁺ → HCO₃⁻ HCO₃⁻+H⁺ → H₂O+CO₂</description></item><item><title>Chemistry of Materials</title><link>https://bhavikdodda.github.io/amethyst/Chemistry_s/Applied-Chemistry/Chemistry-of-Materials/Chemistry-of-Materials/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bhavikdodda.github.io/amethyst/Chemistry_s/Applied-Chemistry/Chemistry-of-Materials/Chemistry-of-Materials/</guid><description> [[Chemistry_s/Applied Chemistry/Chemistry of Materials/Alloys|Alloys]] [[Chemistry_s/Applied Chemistry/Chemistry of Materials/Composite Material|Composite Material]] [[Chemistry_s/Applied Chemistry/Chemistry of Materials/Green Chemistry Principles|Green Chemistry Principles]]</description></item><item><title>Composite Material</title><link>https://bhavikdodda.github.io/amethyst/Chemistry_s/Applied-Chemistry/Chemistry-of-Materials/Composite-Material/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bhavikdodda.github.io/amethyst/Chemistry_s/Applied-Chemistry/Chemistry-of-Materials/Composite-Material/</guid><description>What are composite materials? Composite materials are a material system which is made up of 2 or more physically distinct substances but its properties are entirely different from its constituent materials. Even wood is a naturally occurring composite material (cellulose fibre+lignin).

Strength:  Strength of polymers increases with the chain length or the molecular weight of the polymer.No molecular polymer are soft or gummy and they are also brittle at low temperatures. The mechanical strength of the polymers increases rapidly when the degree of polymerization is more than 150. High molecular weight polymers have more strength and more resistance to heat. The mechanical strength of any polymer also depends upon the nature of inter molecular forces present.</description></item><item><title>Questions</title><link>https://bhavikdodda.github.io/amethyst/Chemistry_s/Applied-Chemistry/Water-Treatment/Questions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bhavikdodda.github.io/amethyst/Chemistry_s/Applied-Chemistry/Water-Treatment/Questions/</guid><description>What is the need for &amp;ldquo;desalination of water&amp;rdquo; programme? # Rise in population→water sources insufficient→desalination programme is required
