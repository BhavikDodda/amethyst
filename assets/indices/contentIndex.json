As to make stable \n    \n3.  Sna to make stronger. \n    \n4.  Properties of brass \n    \n    1.  Brass is highly ductile. This ductility comes from the addition of zinc. Addition of zinc makes the brass porous. (Can start corrosion) \n        \n    2.  Brass is more malleable, can be easily beaten into sheets or into any desired shape, without breaking.  \n        \n    3.  Brass is more resistant to corrosion compared to copper and zinc. \n        \n    4.  High tensile strength. \n        \n    5.  Anti bacterial properties. \n        \n5.  Uses of brass \n    \n    1.  Decorative and anti bacterial uses. Door knobs, lamp fittings, dish washer fittings, decorative items such as photo frames, troffees are generally made from brass. \n        \n    2.  Mechanical applications. Many parts and instruments which involve low friction can be made up of brass. Eg: plumbing tools, gears, shell casings, bearings, because brass has extended life compared to copper and zinc. \n        \n    3.  Musical instruments such as French horns, tambourine, trumpets are made of brass. \n        \n6.  Types of brass \n    \n    1.  Based on the content, brasses can be classified as \n        \n        1.  Red brass \n            \n        2.  Cartridge/260 brass/yellow brass \n            \n        3.  330 brass: used for making tubes and poles \n            \n        4.  360 brass: most common. Easily machined. \n            \n        5.  Navel brass: which is used in the bottom of the ship. \n            \n7.  Corrosion of brass \n    \n    1.  Brass is easily attacked by ammonia or amino compounds. \n        \n    2.  If the zinc concentration is very high it makes the brass structure more porous, resulting in leaching.  \n        \n\n## Steel \n\n1.  It is a metal-nonmetal alloy made up iron and carbon mainly with minute quantities of chromium, nickel, tungsten, niobium. \n    \n2.  In steel the carbon atoms being much smaller occupy the interstitial positions. Other elements like chromium, Nb, Ni distort the regular packing of iron atoms, making the structure more dense and stronger. \n    \n3.  Steel can be mainly classified into \n    \n    1.  Low carbon steel: the carbon content is less than 0.3% by weight.  \n        \n        1.  This type of carbon is relatively soft but highly ductile. This kind of steel is easily machinable and ideal for welding. Generally containers for regular domestic, automobile body parts are made up of low carbon steel.  \n            \n        2.  A special category of low carbon steel is high steel-low alloy where the carbon content varies from 0.05-0.25% by weight,  but it also contains 2% manganese along with nickel and copper for additional strength and hardness.  \n            \n        3.  HSLA is widely used for materials which undergo high wear and tear or are under immense pressure. Eb: bridges, bridge cables, pressure vessels. \n            \n    2.  Medium carbon steel: the carbon content is 0.3-0.6% by weight. \n        \n        1.  Relatively stronger but less ductile. Nickel, chromium, molybdenum are added to increase the hardness \n            \n        2.  Widely used in railway tracks, wheels, gears, machine parts etc. \n            \n    3.  High carbon steel: the carbon content is more than 0.6% by weight \n        \n        1.  They are hardest and the strongest type of steel. \n            \n        2.  They have no ductility. \n            \n        3.  They are highly resistant to wear and tear. \n            \n        4.  Knifes, razors, blades are often made up of high carbon steel. \n            \n4.  Based on usage steel can be classified as \n    \n    1.  Tool steels \n        \n    2.  Stainless steel",

    "content": "# Properties\n\n1.  High chemical reactivity and catalytic property due to high surface area to volume ratio. \n    \n2.  Change in thermal properties compared to bulk. Ex: melting point of nano materials is very much different compared to bulk media. \n    \n3.  Electronic properties: the band gap of nanomaterials increase with decrease in size. Thus, semi conductors can be tuned by playing with the size. \n    \n4.  Optical properties: due to change in size, the energy difference between the orbitals also change resulting in a very different excitation wavelength of the nano material. \n    \n5.  Magnetic : due to small size of the nanomaterials the arrangement of surface atoms or molecules becomes highly aligned in one or two directions and this gives rise to properties like super paramagnetism, ferro and ferri magnetism. \n    \n\n# Synthesis of nanomaterials \n\nAll the synthetic materials can be classified into two categories \n\n1.  Top down: the top down methods include volmil method, electric sputtering method, laser ablation, photo chemical etching techniques  \n    \n2.  Bottom up \n    \n\t1.  In the bottom up method techniques like pyrolysis, sol-gel, canonization, evaporation, electro spinning, emulsion templating are used. \n    \n\n-   For preparation of nanotube,  nanowires, nanorods techniques like anodization, evaporation and electro spinning are used. \n    \n-   For nanoporous materials, emulsion templating and photochemical etching methods are used \n    \n-   For nano particles,  ballmill, electric sputtering and pyrolysis are used.  \n    \n\n# Sol-gel\nNano scale solid materials from small molecules. These molecules are generally hydroxide or alcoxides of metals such as silicon,  titanium,  gold. The process involves conversion of the monomeric hydroxide or alcoxides into polymeric colloidal solution. \n\nThe colloidal solution as a precursor for the formation of an integrated network or gel like structure which is formed due to the removal of liquid through evaporation or heating. Evaporation leads top formation of a compact structure leading to formation of aerogel if the interconnected network is heated rapidly or treated with supercritical fluid for removal of the liquid material then a porous structure is formed which is known as aerogel (has large pores which are formed after heating). \n\nThe whole process of sol-gel process can be divided into 6 steps: \n\n1.  Formation of stable compounds through hydrolysis and condensation.  \n    \n2.  Gelation which is formation of an oxide or alcoxide of bridged network through poly condensation.  \n    \n3.  Aging of gel which is also known as synerasis: in this step the bridged network collapses with removal of the liquid material. \n    \n4.  Drying of gel: after the formation of aerogel/xerogel it is very important to remove water and other volatile compounds from the mixture. Hence it is heated to temperatures around 200 Celsius. This step is very important because the rate of heating, the critical point where removal starts and the temperature decreases highly influences the size of the nanomaterials. The next two steps are not performed generally.  \n    \n5.  Dehydration: removal of surface bound metal hydroxide and metal alcoxide grows by heating up to 800 deg celsius. \n    \n6.  Densification and decomposition : the material after dehydration is heated to temperatures above 800 deg celsius to remove the remaining organic materials. It also collapses the pores of the gel.  \n    \n\n## Advantages of sol-gel  \n\n1.  It is very economic and usually low temperature maintained process \n    \n2.  The thickness of the protein can be varied from a few nanometers to 500 nanometers. \n    \n3.  Any geometry or complex shape can be achieved very easily in the gel. \n    \n4.  High purity and the composition is also controllable. If any spent is to be added the  its amount can be also controlled very easily. \n    \n\n## Disadvantages of sol-gel  \n\n1.  These materials made through sol-gel process are not at all industry friendly because of weak bonding, low wear and tear and high permeability. \n    \n2.  Coatings  \n    \n3.  Develops cracks very easily.  \n    \n4.  Organic materials trapped inside the pores have different thermal expansion properties compared to the nanoparticles and thus can have problems during temperature variation.",

    "title": "Corrosion",
    "content": "Corrosion is defined as any unwanted destruction of a metal or non metal substance by its surroundings due to chemical,  electrical,  electrochemical attack is known as corrosion.\n\n# **Types:**\n\n## Dry corrosion\n\n## Wet corrosion/electrochemical corrosion \n\nIt can take place via two different mechanisms \n\n1.  Evolution of hydrogen gas: this mechanism generally takes place in acidic solutions where fair amount of h+ ions are present. \n    \n    1.  In this mechanism the metal first gets oxidized to an ionic state with release of electrons. M-\u003e M^n+ + ne- \n        \n    2.  In the second step the h+ ions present in the solution or atmosphere accept the e- and get reduced to h2 gas. The amount of gas is very low and it is also a slow process. nH+ + ne- -\u003e n/2H2 \n        \n    3.  Hydrogen gas evolved is very little and the rate is very slow. \n        \n2.  Absorption of oxygen gas/dissolved oxygen \n    \n    1.  This mechanism takes place where metals are in constant contact with stagnant water. In stagnant water, the amount of dissolved oxygen increases due to microbial activity and prescence of aquatic life forms. This dissolved oxygen accepts electrons and gets reduced to hydroxide ions. These hydroxide ions may further react with the oxidized metal resulting in formation of metal hydroxides.  1/2O2 + H2O + 2e- -\u003e 2OH- \n        \n## Galvanic corrosion/bimetallic corrosion  \n    \nThis type of corrosion takes place when two dissimilar metals are electrically connected or exposed to an electrolyte solution. The metal which lies at a higher position in the electrochemical series gets oxidized. The electrons which are released are consumed for either hydrogen evolution or oxygen adsorption. \n        \n## Concentration cell corrosion\n\n* It is defined as the electrochemical attack on the metal surface which is exposed to electrolyte solutions of varying concentrations or varying aeration. \n* The concentration cell corrosion due to varying aeration is also known as differential aeration corrosion.  \n* This kind of corrosion takes place at a faster rate in inaccessible parts of the metal\n* It is also accelerated due to accumulation of dirt, sand, mud, scale, sludge etc. \n\n## Pitting corrosion\n\n* It is a highly localized and accelerated attack on the metal surface resulting in formation of cavities around the metal, most of which is unattached. It leads to development of pinholes,  pits, cavities. \n* It is characterized by very small anodic part and large cathodic part. \n* It is accelerated near rough surfaces or non uniform protective layers, sharp edges, scratches, local straining of metal, turbulent flow of chemical over a metal, deposition of dust or moisture. \n\n## Intergranular corrosion\n\n* This kind of corrosion does not take place on the metal surface but takes place on the grain boundary when corrosive liquid or moisture seeps through the metal surface. \n* It is most dangerous type of corrosion because it is not apparently visible on the surface and it takes place inside alloys at a much faster rate compared to pure metals. \n* It can be prevented by decreasing the amount of doping atoms within the alloy. For example, corrosion of chromium carbide can be decreased by decreasing the carbon content. \n\n## Waterline corrosion\nIt takes place in metallic storage tanks where water is stored for a long period of time. It can be also called a special type of concentration cell corrosion due to long storage of water the amount of dissolved oxygen and salts get accumulated in the tank. Again, growth of algae and aquatic plants also increases the oxygen content. Happens due to difference in concentration of dissolved oxygen and ions. \n    \n## Stress corrosion\n\n* Takes place due to a combined effect of static tensile stresses and corrosive environment on the metal.\n* It is a highly localized attack around the areas under stress. However, the overall corrosion is relatively low. This type of corrosion is observed in chemical industries and laboratories where the presence of chemical fumes and gasses makes the environment highly corrosive.\n* For example, fumes of caustic alkalis and nitrate based compounds can even induce corrosion in mild steel. Brass is readily attacked by fumes of ammonia whereas stainless steel gets corroded by vapors of acid chloride. \n\n# Factors influencing corrosion  \n\n1.  Nature of the metal \n    \n    1.  Position of the metal in the galvanic series: based on how readily substances undergo corrosion. The substance or the metal which is at a higher position in the galvanic series gets easily corroded. \n        \n    2.  Overvoltage: less the overvoltage,  higher will be the corrosion rate. Overvoltage is the difference between actual and observed voltages of reactions. \n        \n    3.  Relative areas or cathodic and anodic parts \n        \n    4.  Purity of the metal \n        \n    5.  Physical state which includes grain size, orientation of Crystal's \n        \n    6.  Nature of the surface film.  \n        \n        1.  Pascivity is defined as reluctance of a metal to undergo corrosion at the regular rate due to formation of a very thin stable oxide layer on the metal surface. Generally the thickness of such an oxide film is around 0.0004mm. Metals showing passivity generally occupy .... position in the position of galvanic series. \n            \n        2.  Order of passivity: Tl, Al, Cr, Be, Mo, Mg~Ni, Co, Fe (least, highest) \n            \n        3.  Sometimes, metal may form an insoluble salt on the surface thus protecting it. Eg. Lead gets covered with lead sulphate. \n            \n    7.  Solubily or volatility of the corrosion product\n\n2.  Nature of environment \n    \n    1.  Temperature influences the rate of corrosion highly. In summer, when the temperature is high corrosion takes place at a faster rate compared to winter \n        \n    2.  As the humidity increases in the environment,  the moisture content also increases which leads to faster corrosion. The value of relative humidity from where the rate of corrosion increases sharply is known as critical humidity  \n        \n    3.  Presence of impurities like carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, NO_x increases the ionic character of the environment and which increases the rate of corrosion. \n        \n    4.  Suspended particles like particulate matter, soot when present in air trap moisture for a long period of time which increases the corrosion rate. (Pm2.5, PM 100) \n        \n    5.  Rate of corrosion is minimum when the pH=7, as the ph increases or decreases from this value (7) the rate bnb of corrosion increases rapidly. \n        \n    6.  Nature of ions present in solution: the presence of certain ions such as silicate ions which form insoluble salts reduces the rate of corrosion whereas the ions like h+, NH4, and copper increases the rate of corrosion.  \n        \n    7.  Flow velocity of processed steam: in boilers and steam processing industry, the rate of formation of stem contributes to corrosion. At higher flow velocities, steam carries small water droplets which increases the corrosion of metal bodies. \n        \n    8.  Polarization of electrodes: electrodes made up of less polarizable material are prone/susceptible to corrosion at a faster rate. \n        \n\n# Control of corrosion, preventing corrosion  \n\n1.  Proper choice of material and proper designing : corrosion even if it occurs, proper designing can slow down the corrosion process.  \n    \n    1.  In highly corroding atmosphere avoid contact of dissimilar metals. Even if two dissimilar metals are used, the area of contact between them should be minimum.  \n        \n    2.  The dissimilar metals should be very close to one another in the galvanic series. If possible, insulating fittings should be used to avoid metal-metal contact. \n        \n    3.  Reduce inhomogenities of sharp corners, stress on metal parts. \n        \n    4.  If possible, use pure metal. Alloys should be used in parts which undergo regular wear and tear. \n        \n2.  Environment \n    \n    1.  Modify the environment by making it less corrosive. Regular deaeration should be carried out for removal of dissolved oxygen or carbon dioxide from water containing ... Oxygen deactivation by the use of chemicals such as sodium sulphide and ammonia. Silica gels and alumina can be used to absorb moisture from the humid atmosphere. \n        \n    2.  For neutralization of acidic environments, fumes of calculated amount of ammonia can be used\n\n3. Cathodic protection involves converting the more reactive anode into a less reactive material by making it function as a cathode. The anode involved in the corrosion can be converted into cathode by the following two methods \n\n\t1.  Sacrificial anodic protection: where a more reactive or alloy is connected or coated in the top of the anode. The metal which is used for covering or coating gets itself corroded and protects the actual anode. The metal used for covering or coating is known as the sacrificial anode. \n\t2.  Impressed current cathodic protection: in this method, the anodic and cathodic materials are connected to an external battery in such a way that it nullifies the flow of electrons taking place due to corrosion.  \n1.  Use of inhibitors \n\n\t1.  There are certain metals which get corroded easily but their insoluble salts do not undergo any oscillate. Anides like chromate, sulphate, arsenate, phosphates form insoluble salts with the anodic material and covers it up which prevents further corrosion. \n\n\t1.  Organic inhibitors such as glycerol, mercaptans, amines, petrocyclic nitrogen compounds are added to the solution which either slow down the movement of h+ ion, or consume it up. \n            \n1.  Use of protective coatings such as paints or metal coatings.  \n    \n    1.  The coating must have the following two properties. \n        \n        1.  It should be inert or it should have a inert layer on top of it. \n            \n        2.  It should completely block the penetration of the corrosive environment.  \n            \n    2.  Protective coatings can be of two types: \n        \n        1.  Anodic (sacrificial anode): ex: coating of zinc, aluminium or cadmiumon steel or fe \n            \n        2.  In cathodic coating, the anodic metal is coated with a noble/inert metal. Eg: coating of chromium, tin, on iron\n\nRefractory metals : high bp/mp \n\n# Methods of application of protective coatings \n\n1.  Hot dipping: in this method, metals or alloys which are to be protected (iron, stainless steel) are dipped into a hot solution of another relatively inert metal having lower melting point such as zinc, copper, tin, lead. Based on the type of metal used for protective coating it can be classified into many types, but the major two types are: \n    \n    1.  Galvanizing: coating with zinc \n        \n        1.  Metal is dipped in dil H2SO4 at 60-90C  \n            \n        2.  Acid is removed by washing \n            \n        3.  It is then heated for drying \n            \n        4.  Dipped into a solution of molten zinc which is covered with a layer of molten NH4Cl to prevent the oxidation of it. \n            \n        5.  Passed through rollers to remove excess molten zinc. \n            \n    2.  Tinining: coating with tin \n        \n        1.  Same as galvanizing \n            \n        2.  Molten tin is covered with two layers: palm oil and molten ZnCl2 (binding agent, increases the stickiness of the molten on the metal sheet) \n            \n        3.  Doesn't include washing and drying processes. \n            \n2.  Metal cladding: protecting of mild steel by sandwiching it between stainless steel. Will also increase the overall strength. \n    \n3.  Electroplating: doing electrolysis by keeping one end with the metal we want to coat. It is the best method for durability. \n    \n4.  Potentiometric anodic  protection: this method is similar to impressed cathodic current method. \n    \n    1.  In this method the metal which need to be protected is connected to a potentiometric setup and the potential is slowly increased in the negative direction and at the same time the current is monitored. \n    2. Critical potential is defined as the minimum potential required to render the surface of the metal passive.",

It can be also called as the mechanism of drug action. However,  the mechanism or mode of drug action may contain an additional stage known as pharmaceutical phase.  \n\nPharmacology consists of two stages: \n\n1.  Pharmacokinetics: it is referred to as the action of the body on the drug and it consists of 4 different processes \n    \n    1.  Absorption: it is the process by which drugs enter the body. Whatever root of administration may be used, the drug should cross all the tissue membranes (skin, epithelium subcutaneous,  capillary wall) to enter the blood flow. \n        \n    2.  Digestion: it refers to the movement of the drug around the body. After entering the blood, the drug molecules must reach the targeted cells. In most cases, blood is the medium of distribution. \n        \n    3.  Metabolism: it is the process by which drugs are biochemically altered to make them sufficiently water soluble for excretion with urine or stool. This process takes place in multiple organs such as liver, gut wall, kidney,  intestine,  skin.  \n        \n    4.  Excretion: it is the process by which the drugs and its products after metabolism leave the body. Water soluble drugs do not undergo much metabolism and are excreted through urine. Lipid soluble drugs are converted into water soluble products and then excreted via kidney or via Bile.  \n        \n2.  Pharmacodynamics: it is the mechanism where drugs exert their effects on the body which includes therapeutic effect or toxic effects when the drugs interact with the receptors present in the body. In short, pharmacodynamics can also be called as drug receptor interaction. There is a direct correlation between drug concentration and its effects. Pharmacodynamics refers to the relationship of drug concentration at the site of action and the resulting affect. It also includes the time course and intensity of the therapeutic or toxic effects. Drug usually works by binding to a receptor and producing desired effects. The concentration of the drug at the receptor site determines the intensity and the effect of the drug. Other factors included in pharmacodynamics: \n    \n    1.  Mechanism by which signal is translated into cell by secondary messages \n        \n    2.  Gene translation and protein synthesis for producing therapeutic/ toxic effects.  \n        \n\n# Some important terms  \n\n1.  t_1/2Half life: it is defined as the time required for the plasma concentration of a drug to be reduced by 50% of its initial concentration.  \n    \n2.  ED_50 effective dose: The dose of the drug that is effective for a 50% of the population exposed to the drug.  \n    \n3.  LD_50 Lethal dose: the drug dose which causes death in 50% of the population is known as LD_50 \n    \n4.  Drug bioavailable: it refers to the extent of a substance or a drug that becomes completely available to the intended biological destinations. It is defined as the measure of rate or fraction of the initial dose that successfully reaches the intended destination. The absolute bioavailability of a drug administered by any extra vascular method is generally less than 1. \n    \n\nThe factors which effect the bioavailability are: \n\n1.  Root of administration  \n    \n2.  With or without food. \n    \n3.  Influence of other drugs \n    \n4.  Metabolism rate of the individual \n    \n5.  Age or diseased state. \n    \n\n## Drug receptor interaction:  \n\nThe drug receptor interaction can be explained on the basis of lock and key mechanism. The receptors present in the body are made up of different kinds of proteins. Depending upon the nature of protein, the receptors can have cavities of domains of different sizes and shapes present in them.  \n- Drugs need to be modified according to the receptors. Amoxylin vs. Penicillin\n\n# Vitamins \n\nThey are organic compounds complexes with metals and are necessary for normal functioning of living organisms but are not synthesized within the living organisms.  \n\n- Water soluble vitamins: vitamin B,C\n- Fat soluble: A,D,E,K \n- Water and fat insoluble: vitamin H (biotin) \n\n",

    "title": "Dyes",
    "content": "A dye is defined as the organic, inorganic or combination of both substance which are easily absorbed retained by fibre, impart color and withstand drying, washing and exposure to light over a long period of time. \n\nThe first synthetic dye was discovered by Henry Perkin when he accidentally colored silk during the oxidation of Aniline.  \n\n# What do dyes do?\n* Impart color\n* Soluble in water/organic solvent/ or both.\n* Ability to get absorbed and retained on the fiber.\n* Should be able to withstand color fastness while washing and drying\n\n# Pigments \n* Pigments are also organic molecules or metal organic complexes which impart color but they are different from dyes because they are not soluble in water/organic solvent/or both.\n* they do not reach the bulk of the fiber upon their application.\n* Pigments are used only to color the outer surface especially that of polymeric chains or fibres.\n\n# WITT's Theory\n\nAccording to Witt's theory of dyes all organic dyes have two important groups\n1. Chromophore\n\t1. They are the functional groups which are responsible for the color of the dye\n2. Auxophore\n\t1. They are functional groups which deepens the color of the dye\n\n\u003e Mordents: Chemical comppounds which help the dye to adhere to the fabric by forming a bridge between the two.\n\u003e Most of the times they are heavy metal salts.\n\n# Classification of dyes\n\n## Based on source\n1. Natural dyes: Dyes derived/extracted from natural sources such as plant, microbes, animals and minerals\n2. Suffer from many disadvantages\n\t1. Poor to moderate light fastness\n\t2. Very less affinity for synthetic fibres\n\t3. They require heavy metal salts as mordants\n\t4. Natural dyes are extracted most of the time\n\t5. Overall extraction yield is very low considering the fact it requires huge amount of land and water\n3. Advantage: Safe to use and environment friendly\n4. Natural dyes can be monogenetic or polygenetic\n\t1. Monogenetic dyes: Dyes which produce only one color irrespective of the moderant used.\n\t2. Polygenetic dyes: Dyes whose color depends upon the moderant used.\n\t3. Can be further classified as:\n\t\t1. Adjective (additive) dyes: They do not bind to the fabric without the use of moderant. Hence the fibre must be pre treated with moderant. eg: Indigo, alkanate, Archil (orchid)\n\t\t2. Substansive dyes: They can be used without pre treatment. eg: Safflower, cochineal, black walnut\n5. Synthetic dyes: Are the dyes which are synthesized from organic compounds\n\t1. Ex: Alizarin, Fast green, Eosin, Picric Acid\n\n## On the basis of chromophore\n\n1. Azodyes: where the chromophore is -N||N-. Ex: Methyl orange\n2. Triphenyl methane. Ex: Malachite Green, Leucomalachite Green\n3. Pthalein dyes are derivatives of Pthalic anhydrides.\n\n## Based on method of application\n\n10/2/2023 \n\n1.  Reactive dyes: they adhere very well on to the fabric. Very rarely mordents are used in this case. The dye solution prepared in water or any other organic solvent. Then the fabric is dipped into the solution, agitated well for a few hours and then taken out, washed with water and dried. Examples: Procion, Orange Mx2r. These dyes show very good light and washing fastness. \n    \n2.  Acid dyes: these dyes require pretreatment with slightly acidic solutions. Most of the nylon based fabrics and acrylics are dyed using acid dyes. They show good light fastness but their washing fastness is not so good and hence regular fabrics are not dyed using acid dyes. Ex: acid blue 78 \n    \n3.  Premetallized dyes: these types of dyes are complex dyes which are used along with acidic solution and few molecules/atoms of metals(Cr) \n    \n4.  Direct dyes: they are applied to cellulose based fibres like jute, cotton. These dyes are directly used in a hot dye bath without any mordents. Eg: Congo red, Direct fast brown M, Brilliant Yellow. These dyes produce bright colors. However these dyes do not have any fastness towards light washing or drying.  \n    \n5.  Azoic dyes: these kind of dyes result in formation of azo bonds (n||n) upon their application onto the fabric. These dyes might be initially colorless or very light colored but upon binding with the fabric, deep and bright colors. Eg: 4 chloro2nitroaniline, 3 chloro2methylaniline, 1amino2methylanthragnione. These dyes are used for natural fibres like cellulose and silk.  \n    \n6.  Dispersed dyes: these kind of dyes have very low water solubility. They are non ionic in nature and they are dyed hot. Most of the acetate based fibres are dyed with dispersed dyes. Eg: disperse red, disperse yellow. These dyes show very good fastness and bright colors.  \n    \n7.  Vat dyes: oldest type of dye used. They are water insoluble dyes. Their solution is prepared in water in presence of NaOH+ NaHSO3. The temperature of the solution is maintained at 50 deg C and the fabrics are dipped and agitated vigorously for 15-20 min. Cotton and most cellulose based fabrics are suitable for these dyes. They are available in different shades and show relatively good fastness. Eg: indigo, tyrian purple. \n    \n8.  Basic dyes: these kind if dyes are applied under basic conditions. Most of them are cationic dyes and their color can be improved by steaming. Eg: rhodamine, crystal violet. \n    \n9.  Sulphur dyes: they are known to produce blackish and dull shades. Most cellulose based fibres are treated with mordents and then dipped into a solution containing the sulphur dyes to produce different shades of black color. Advantage: they show good fastness and are very economical. Disadvantage: only black and dull shades. \n    \n\n# Mechanism of dying \n\nThe dying mechanism involves four steps \n\n1.  Transfer of the dye to the fibre surface. \n    \n2.  Adsorption of the dye onto the fibre surface. \n    \n3.  Diffusion of the dye from the surface of the fibre to the bulk. \n    \n4.  Interaction of the dye molecules through chemical reaction or physical forces with the fibre. Types of interactions between dye and fibre: \n    \n    1.  Ionic \n        \n    2.  Covalent  \n        \n    3.  Coordinate \n        \n    4.  Hydrogen bond \n        \n    5.  Dipole-dipole or ion-dipole \n        \n    6.  Wanderwaal  \n        \n## Factors affecting dyeing mechanism\n\n1. Temperature of the dye bath\n\t1. Decides the solubility and even distribution of the dye throughout the solution.\n\t2. Also increases the ionic nature of the dye.\n\t3. Special cases:\n\t\t1. Cellulose based fibres: Temperature of the dye bath swells the fibre and helps in even distribution of the dye molecules throughout the fibre.\n\t\t2. Disperse dyes: Increase in temperature helps in breaking down the micellarr aggregates into smaller groups which can be easily adsorbed by the fibre\n\t4. Increased temp. also promotes the vibrational activity which increase the rate of migration of the dye onto the fibre.\n2. Environment: Type of solvent, quantity of solvent\n3. Presence of suitable pH, plectrolytes (moderants), dispersing agents\n4. Substantivity of the dye: Dye0fibre interaction under a given set of conditions\n5. Physical/chemical/mechanical forces applied during dyeing\n6. Rate of adsorption\n\t1. The dye is transferred onto the fibre via adsorption\n\t2. Chemical adsorption: the forces of attraction are much stronger and form a permannetn bond between the dye and fibre.\n\t3. Physical adsorption is often reversible in nature.\n\t4. When a fibre is dipped into a aqueous solution the fibre acquires a electrostatic potential which helps in retaining the dye molecules on the surface of the fibre. Such kind of electrostatic potential is known as zeta potential. Eg:\n\t\t1. Cellulose based fibres gain -ve charge on their surface.\n\t\t2. Protein based fibres like silk may gain -ve or +ve charge based on the pH of the solution and isoelectric point of the protein.\n\t\t\t1. Isoelectric point: pH which contains the switter ionic structure and the overall charge is 0\n\n## Kinetics of Dye mechanism\n\nIt is the study of the rate of dying, measurement of the rate and the mechanism of the dyeing process at different temperatures.\nThe rate of the reaction will depend on:\n* Concentration of dye\n* Collision frequency",

[[Chemistry_s/Applied Chemistry/Polymers/Thermoplastics|Thermoplastic Resins]]\n2. [[Chemistry_s/Applied Chemistry/Polymers/Thermosetting Resins|Thermosetting Resins]]\n\n# Compounding\nPolymers are generally mixed with a wide variety of substances which impart a certain functionality or a desired property to the polymers. The finished product after the molding process is known as plastic.\n\nAdditives:\n* Impart properties to plastics\n* Make the processing easy\n\nCompounding: Mixing of additives to virgin plastics\n\n1.  Resins : it is the binder which holds the different constituents or polymeric chains together. \n    \n2.  Plasticizers: they are added to increase the flexibility of the material. It should be kept in mind that adding plasticerzs decreases the mechanical strength and chemical resistance of the polymer. Eg: vegetable oil, camphor, esters and organic phosphates \n    \n3.  Fillers: they increase the hardness, tensile strength and workability of the material. It also reduces the cost, shrinkage and brittleness of the material. Eg: carborundum, quartz, mica \n    \n4.  Catalysts: they are only added to therosetting plastics for their easy molding. \n    \n5.  Stabilizers: thermal and chemical stabilizers are also added so that the polymers do not chemically react when exposed to high temperatures during the molding process \n    \n6.  Lubricants: they are added to prevent the sticking of the polymers to the mold. They also impart a glossy finish to the end product. \n    \n7.  Coloring material.\n\n# Moulding\n\n1.  Injection moulding: \n\t1. Applicable for only thermoplastics.\n\t2. in injection moulding, the polymers mixed with other additives are fed through a injection like syringe whose nossel is kept at high temperature. \n\t3. The polymer along with additives is fed into the syringe with the means of a hopper. \n    \n2.  Compression molding: In this, the molten plastic material (already mixed with additives) is taken in form of a lump and kept in the lower part of a mold. Then from the top, the other half of the mold compresses the lump at high pressure. Due to the pressure, the lump takes the shape of the mold.  \n    \n3.  Transfer moulding: is similar to injection moulding. The only difference being that due to high friction near the nozzle, temperatures are increased tremendously which convert the molten plastic into liquid state. The liquid state allows easy flow and better packing along with better finishing of the final material.  \n    \n4.  Extrusion moulding: this technique does not uses any mould. Hence it is also known as \"extrusion process\". \n\t1. Material is introduced and electrically heated and pushed by a screw conveyer.\n\t2. Used for drawing long wires from a molten mass. \n\t3. Most of the times, cylindrical pipes, wires,  materials of uniform cross sections,  are made using extrusion moulding.\n6. Blow moulding: Hot softened tube of thermoplastic is placed between two halves of mould and compressed air is blown where the plastic takes the shape of the mould\n\t1. Used to form hollow articles like bottles, cans etc.\n",

    "title": "Properties",
    "content": "Properties of [[Chemistry_s/Applied Chemistry/Polymers/Polymers|Polymers]]\n1.  Strength:  \n    \n    1.  Strength of polymers increases with the chain length or the molecular weight of the polymer.No molecular polymer are soft or gummy and they are also brittle at low temperatures. The mechanical strength of the polymers increases rapidly when the degree of polymerization is more than 150. High molecular weight polymers have more strength and more resistance to heat. The mechanical strength of any polymer also depends upon the nature of inter molecular forces present. \n        \n    2.  Mechanical strength of polymers can be increased by introduction of more polar groups. Ex: OH, COOH, NH2 which are capable of hydrogen bonding. \n        \n2.  Plastic deformation is observed in thermoplastics. During the deformation the intermolecular forces between the different chains get easily broken upon application of heat or mechanical strength. This property is utilized for molding and reshaping of plastic materials. The polymeric chains which can slip one over another can undergo easy deformation. \n    \n\nEx : reversible plastic deformation is a common property of linear chain polymers. \n\n3.  Physical State: Polymeric materials maybe crystalline or amorphous based upon their  \n    \n    1.  repeating units  \n        \n    2.  Cross linking \n        \n    3.  Packing properties \n        \n    \n    Long repeating units generally impart a very low degree of symmetry to the polymers and these kind of polymers do not crystallize easily. \n    \n    Ex : polystyrene, pmma \n    \n    Crystal nature of the polymer is responsible for denser packing of the molecules, thus increasing the intermolecular forces of attraction. Crystalline polymers are characterized by sharp and high softening temperature.  \n    \n    Irl,  nothing is 100% crystalline or amorphous. \n    \n    Polymers are generally made up of cyrstallite beads embedded in amorphous matrix. \n    \n    Elastomers are elastic in nature and are highly entangled. \n    \n4.  Chemical Resistance: Densely packed polymers have very little gaps between the polymeric chains, hence it becomes very difficult for the solvent of chemical molecules to penetrate and attack the polymer. \n    \n    1.  Polythene can be dissolved in Carbon tetra chloride / benzene / became (non polar) \n        \n    2.  Imp points: \n        \n        1.  Tendency to swell decreases with molecular weight  \n            \n        2.  High molecular weight polymers when dissolved, produce highly viscous solutions. \n            \n        3.  More the crystalline nature of the polymer, more will be the resistance towards chemical attack. \n            \n        4.  More the cross linking, more will be the resistance to solvent attack. \n            \n\n5.  Effect of heat:  \n    \n    1.  Amorphous polymers do not have any melting point but they are characterized by a softening point. At low temperature amorphous polymers are brittle like glass. When heated, they soften at a particular temperature called softening point and become rubber like material.  \n        \n        1.  Glass =\u003e(softening point) rubber =\u003e gum =\u003e liquid  \n            \n    2.  With crystalline polymers there is a transition glass? temperature beyond which they are converted into thermoplastics. This thermoplastic when heated beyond its melting point gets converted into liquid.  \n        \n        1.  Crystalline =\u003e thermoplastics =\u003e liquid",

Bacteria\n3. Partially clarified water is filtered through sand gravity filters: rectangular tanks which contain fine layers of sand\n\n# Sterilization\n\n## 1. By adding bleaching powder\n1kg/1000kl of powder and treated water should contain \u003c0.2ppm Cl\n* CaOCl₂+H₂O → Ca(OH)₂ + Cl₂\n* Cl₂ + H₂O → HCl + HOCl\nHOCl kills the bacteria\n\n### Advantage\n1. Effective, economical\n2. Does not make water hard\n3. Required little storage\n### Disadvantage\n1. Imparts unpleasant taste and odour\n2. Lowers pH below 6.5 and causes irritation to mucus membrane\n\n## 2. Breakpoint chlorination\n\nWhen liquid chlorine is added or gas is passed\n1. Available Cl decreases: consumption of it in oxidizing some organic matter\n2. Increases due to decomposition of chloro-organic compounds\nFree chlorine: destruction of bacteria.\nBreakpoint: point at which residual chlorine begins to appear\n\n### Advantages\n1. Organic matter is oxidized⇒Odour-free\n2. Pathogenic bacteria are destroyed\n3. Prevents growth of weed in water\n\n## 3. Chloramine\n\nCl+NH₃ mixed in 2:1 by volume\n* Cl₂ + NH₃ → ClNH₂ + HCl\n* ClNH₂ + H₂O → HOCl + NH₃\n* HOCl → HCl + \\[O\\]\n\n\\[O\\] nascent oxygen also has bactericidal properties.\n\n## 4. Ozonation\nOzone is unstable and gives \\[O\\]\n\n### Advantage\n1. Sterilization, bleaching, decolorization and deodourazation take place at the same time\n2. Does not change pH\n3. Time of contact is only 10-15min\n\n### Disadvantage\n1. Costly\n\n# Desalination of Brackish Water\nWater containing dissolved salts and having a very salty taste is called brackish water. \nEg: sea water\n## 1. Electrodialysis\n\nBy applying current and employing pair of plastic membranes through which ions can pass\n* Cathode(-): Attracts +ve\n* Anode(+): Attracts -ve\n\n## 2. Reverse Osmosis\nOsmosis: Flow of solvent from dilute to concentrated solution through a semipermeable membrane.\nReverse osmosis: flow of solvent in oppositie direction.\n(Done by applying pressure)\n\n### Advantages\n1. Removal of ionic, non-ionic, colloidal solutes\n2. Renegeneration is easy: replacement of semipermeable membrane\n3. Economical\n4. Continuous supply of large volumes of water\n\nUsually used for purification of sea water for domestic use.",
