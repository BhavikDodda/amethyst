The story # Faraday: Changing magnetic field can induce a current in a wire loop James Clerk Maxwell: Accelerated electric charges/changing electric field generate linked electric and magnetic fields. Based on symmetry argument but not on experimental findings as they are harder to detect. Concluded that light consists of electromagnetic waves Heinrich Hertz: Showed that EM waves do exist.</description></item><item><title>Blackbody Radiation</title><link>https://bhavikdodda.github.io/amethyst/Physics/Quantum-Mechanics/Particle-Properties-of-Waves/2.-Blackbody-Radiation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bhavikdodda.github.io/amethyst/Physics/Quantum-Mechanics/Particle-Properties-of-Waves/2.-Blackbody-Radiation/</guid><description>[[1. Blackbody Radiation]]
What is light? # This story was thought to be complete, i.e., light consisted of EM waves that obeyed Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s theory.
This turned out to not be the complete story.
Blackbody # The ability of a body to radiate is closely related to its ability to absorb radiation
Blackbody: An ideal body that absorbs all radiation incident upon it, regardless of frequency.
Blackbody radiation # Examined by Lord Rayleigh and James Jeans.</description></item><item><title>Photoelectric Effect</title><link>https://bhavikdodda.github.io/amethyst/Physics/Quantum-Mechanics/Particle-Properties-of-Waves/3.-Photoelectric-Effect/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bhavikdodda.github.io/amethyst/Physics/Quantum-Mechanics/Particle-Properties-of-Waves/3.-Photoelectric-Effect/</guid><description>Einstein realized that photoelectric effect could be understood if the energy in light is not spread out over wavefronts but is concentrated in small packets or photons.
Planck thought that although energy from an electric oscillator had to be given to EM waves in separate quanta, the waves themselves behaved exactly as in conventional wave theory. Einstein: Energy was not only given quantazatically but was also carried by waves in separate quanta.</description></item><item><title>Light</title><link>https://bhavikdodda.github.io/amethyst/Physics/Quantum-Mechanics/Particle-Properties-of-Waves/4.-Light/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bhavikdodda.github.io/amethyst/Physics/Quantum-Mechanics/Particle-Properties-of-Waves/4.-Light/</guid><description>[[3. Photoelectric Effect]] is supported by studies of thermionic emission.
Photoelectric effect: photons of light provide energy required by an electron to escape Thermionic emission: heat provides that energy. What is light? # Both a wave and particle:

We can derive the relation by applying conservation of momentum and energy.
$$ \begin{align} \frac{hv}{c}+0=\frac{hv&amp;rsquo;}{c}\cos\phi+p\cos\theta\ \frac{hv&amp;rsquo;}{c}\sin \phi=p\sinÎ¸\ \ \ E=KE+mc^2=\sqrt{m^2c^4+p^2c^2}\ \text{or} \ ((hv-hv&amp;rsquo;)+mc^2)^2=m^2c^4+p^2c^2 \end{align} $$
Relation:
$$ \begin{align} \lambda &amp;lsquo;-\lambda=\frac{h}{mc}(1-\cos\phi)\ \text{Compton wavelength: } \lambda _C=\frac{h}{mc} \end{align} $$</description></item><item><title>Table of Contents</title><link>https://bhavikdodda.github.io/amethyst/Physics/Quantum-Mechanics/Particle-Properties-of-Waves/Particle-Properties-of-Waves/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bhavikdodda.github.io/amethyst/Physics/Quantum-Mechanics/Particle-Properties-of-Waves/Particle-Properties-of-Waves/</guid><description> [[1.
