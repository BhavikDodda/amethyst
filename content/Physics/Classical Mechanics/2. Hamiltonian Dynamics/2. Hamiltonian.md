# Hamiltonian Function
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{dh}{dt}=\frac{dH}{dt}=-\frac{\partial L}{\partial t}\\\\
where\ h=\sum_k \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_k'}q_k'-L\\
where\ H=\sum_k p_k\ q_k'-L
\end{align}
$$

h, H are constant if L doesn't contain time explicitly.

h=constant, a *first integral of motion* called the "**Jacobi's integral**".

$H=T+V$, if system is conservative and T is a homogeneous quadratic function.

# Hamilton's canonical equations of motion

$$
\begin{align}
q_k'=\frac{\partial H}{\partial p_k}\\
p_k'=-\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_k}
\end{align}
