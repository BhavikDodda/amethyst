title: Process of solving using the Hamiltonian
weight: 3
---
1. Define the Lagrangian L=T-V
2. In order to write the Hamiltonian, $q_k$ must be replaced by their corresponding conjugate/generalized momenta $p_k$. $$H=T+V$$
3. Use ![[2. Hamiltonian#Hamilton's canonical equations of motion]]
4. Come up with the differential equation corresponding to every generalized coordinate.
