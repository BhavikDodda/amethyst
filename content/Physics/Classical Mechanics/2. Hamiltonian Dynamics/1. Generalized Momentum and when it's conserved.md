title: Generalized Momentum and when it's conserved
weight: 1

Ex: a particle moving through space with speed x'

T=$\frac{1}{2}mx'^2$

Momentum $mx'$ can be expressed as $\frac{\partial T}{\partial x'}$

> Under the condition that V is not a function of velocity x', then momentum can also be expressed as:

$$
p=\frac{\partial L}{\partial x'}
$$

## Generalized/"conjugate"/"canonical" momentum
In general, **generalized momentum $p_k$** corresponding to generalized coordinate $q_k$:

$$
p_k=\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_k'}
$$

Utilizing this in the lagrangian equation for a conservative system:

$$
p_k'=\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_k}
$$

# Cyclical/ignorable coordinate

Let's say there's a generalized coordinate $q_K$ for which 'L' is not  dependent on.

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_K}=0\Rightarrow p_K'=0\\
\frac{d}{dt}(p_K)=0\\
p_K\ or\ \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_k'}\ is\ constant
\end{align}
$$

## Example
Lagriangian of a particle moving in a central force field, in polar coordinates:

$L=T-V=\frac{1}{2}m(r'^2+r^2\theta '^2)-V(r)$

Since L doesn't contain θ,

$$
p_\theta=\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta '}=mr^2\theta'=constant
$$

Generalized momentum for this coordinate, p\_θ is a constant of motion in time and is a "first integral" since it is gotten by integrating p\_θ'=0

## Takeaway
> If a coordinate corresponding to a translation along a direction is not appearing in the expression of the lagrangian of a system, the coordinate is cyclic and the corresponding conjugate momentum is constant.
