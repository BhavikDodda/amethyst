# Degrees of freedom
The **minimum** number of independent variables or coordinates required to specify the position of a dynamical system, consisting of one or more particles, is called the number of degrees of freedom of the system.

# Constraints
Constraints: Limitations on the motion of a system.
Motion is said to be constrained motion.
## Types
1. Holonomic
	1. Constraints expressible in the form of equation of the form $f(\vec{r_1},\vec{r_2},...,t)=0$ ^077dc7
	2. If the number of particles of a system: N and constraints: m, degrees of freedom=independent coordinates=n=3N-m
	3. Generalized coordinates: $q_1,q_2,q_3,...q_n$; and each coordinate can vary independently.
	4. "Superflous coordinates"=redundant coordinates
5. Nonholonomic
	1. Constraints not expressible in [[#^077dc7|this]] form.
	2. Each coordinate cannot always vary independently ⇒ degrees of freedom < minimum number of coordinates required

Can be also be classified as
1. Conservative
2. Dissipative: Constraint forces do work⇒Total work is not constant.

.
1. Rheonomous: Constraint contains time as an explicit variable. Generally dissipative.
2. Scleronomous: Constraints don't contain time as an explicit variable.
