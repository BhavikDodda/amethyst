## Wien's Law
Wavelength of light at the peak $$\lambda_{max} = \frac{2.9\cdot 10^{-3}}{T} \frac{(meters * kelvin)}{kelvin}$$

# Photoelectric Effect

Kinetic Energy of electron = K.E. = hν - hν₀ where ϕ=hν₀=work function of the metal and ν: frequency of light
According to quantum theory, the intensity of light => number of electrons ejected and frequency of light => kinetic energy of the electrons ejected.

∴Even if there's a high intensity of a low energy light (low frequency) electrons won't get ejected from the surface.
