[[1. Blackbody Radiation]]
# What is light?

This story was thought to be complete, i.e., light consisted of EM waves that obeyed Maxwell's theory.

This turned out to not be the complete story.

# Blackbody

> The ability of a body to radiate is closely related to its ability to absorb radiation

**Blackbody**: An ideal body that absorbs all radiation incident upon it, regardless of frequency.

# Blackbody radiation

Examined by Lord Rayleigh and James Jeans.

They considered radiation inside a cavity of temperature T(absolute) to be a series of standing EM waves.

* Density of standing waves in cavity: $G(v)dv=\frac{8\pi v^2 dv}{c^3}$
* Average energy per standing wave $\bar{ϵ}=\frac{1}{2}kT*2=kT$.
	* One dimensional harmonic oscillator has 2 deg of freedom: Kinetic energy + Potential energy

Rayleigh-Jeans formula: $$u(v)dv=\frac{8\pi v^2 kT}{c^3}$$

For small 'v' it works but as v→∞, energy density→∞ but it should actually fall to 0.

# Planck Radiation Formula

Max Planck's "lucky guesswork"

The oscillators in the cavity walls must have only specific energies $\epsilon _n=nhv$

* Actual average energy per standing wave: $\epsilon =\frac{hv}{e^{hv/kt}-1}$

Plank's radiation formula:
$$
u(v)dv=\frac{8\pi v^2}{c^3}\cdot \frac{hv}{e^{hv/kt}-1}
$$
