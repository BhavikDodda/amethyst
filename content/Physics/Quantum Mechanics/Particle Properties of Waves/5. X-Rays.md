Inverse photoelectric effect.
Bremsstrahlung "breaking radiation": The circumstances under which radiation is produced.

# Duane-Hunt formula
The x-rays produced at a given accelerating potential V vary in wavelength but there is a minimum wavelength of the rays produced.

$$
\lambda _{min}=\frac{1.240*10^{-6}}{V}
$$

Let's ignore the work function and assume the case where the entire kinetic energy Ve is given upp to a single photon of enegy hv_max

$$
\begin{align}
Ve=hv_{max}=\frac{hc}{\lambda _{min}}\\
\lambda _{min}=\frac{hc/e}{V}=\frac{1.240*10^{-6}}{V} m\\
\end{align}
$$

# X-Ray diffraction

Plane wave fronts of the incoming waves on a crystal of regular atoms creates secondary waves which have sperical wave fronts. The scattering involves atoms that absorb incident plane waves and reemit sperical waves of the same frequuency. 

Analysis of the layers of the crystal/Bragg layers can be done using X-ray scattering
