# Special relativity

An object has an intrinsic mass/rest mass m.

Such an object is said to posses a rest-mass energy E=mc²

If an object has momentum p, then its energy is given by

$$
E=\sqrt{p^2c^2+m^2c^4}\approx mc^2+\frac{p^2}{2m}\  for\ p<<mc
$$

Momentum is related to the velocity by

$$\
\begin{align}
p=\gamma mv\\
\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}
\end{align}
$$

Substituting the p, in the expression for E we get:
$$
\begin{align}
E=\gamma mc^2\\
\frac{E}{pc}=\frac{c}{v}
\end{align}
$$

## Photons

Einstein's  view of light is a stream of particles called 'photons' which travel at the speed of light.

Therefore, $E=pc$ and the rest mass=0

Using planck's relation  $E=hv=hc/\lambda$: 
$p=h/\lambda$


These relations are applicable in describing the [[6. Compton Effect|Compton effect]] 

# Radiation: Wave or particle

* Interference and diffraction could be explained only by assuming light is a wave
	* Properties that we talk about: Frequency, Amplitude, Wavelength, Speed
* Photoelectric effect and the Compton effect
	* Properties that we talk about: Energy, momentum

# De-Broglie hypothesis

De-broglie suggested that if photons have wave light property, all matter should do too.

We know that light of wavelength λ has momentum $p=h/\lambda$

De-broglie suggested that matter of moment p have a wavelength $\lambda = h/p$

## Consequences

[[3. Bohr Atom and Specific Heats of Gases and Solids#Stable orbits of Bohr's model|Bohr's quantization]] condition can be explained with the De-broglie hypothesis.

In terms of De-Broglie wavelength, it can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{align}
(h/\lambda)r=n\hbar\\
n\lambda=2\pi r
\end{align}
$$
i.e. Orbits are stable if the orbit length contains integer multiples of De-Broglie wavelength. Phases line up, and there is sustained oscillation.
