title: Wave Packets, Phase and Group Velocity
weight: 5
---
The microscopic world is telling us that we should think of radiation and electrons as both a particle and a wave, so we develop a mathematical description which has both particle properties and wave properties through a concept called 'wave packet'

# Wave Packet

* It is localized and moves together as an entity: particle property
* Within the wave packet there a few oscillations: wave property

Phase velocity: the velocity of the wave that has the higher wavenumber
Group velocity: the velocity of the wave packet, the wave that has the lower wavenumber.
