In dielectric solid most of the electrons are bound to the nuclear
When an external E field is applied→centroid of electronic cloud is displaced from the centroid of the nucleus→dipole is created and atom is said to be polarized.
# Types of polarization

* Electronic polarization
* Ionic polarization
* Orientational/Dipolar polarization
* Space charge polarization

# Clausius Mossotti's equation

### It can be derived using:

$$
\begin{align}
P=N\alpha E_{int}\\
\\
P=\frac{E}{\epsilon-\epsilon_0}
\\
Lorentz\ field\ eq: E_{int}=E+\frac{P}{3\epsilon_0}\\
\\
\epsilon/\epsilon_0 = \epsilon_r
\end{align}
$$

P: total polarization
α: polarizability

# The equation

$$
\frac{N\alpha}{3\epsilon _0}=\frac{\epsilon_r-1}{\epsilon_r+2}
$$
