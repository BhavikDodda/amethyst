# Metastable state

* Required for population inversion
* Has a longer lifetime $10^{-6} \rightarrow 10^{-3}s$
* Created between the energy levels where we want to control and hold the atoms.
* We do stimulated emission of atoms at the metastable state.

# Pumping mechanisms for [[Physics/Lasers/1. Lasers Intro#Population Inversion|population inversion]]

1. Optical pumping
	1. Light is used for stimulated absorption.
	2. Used in solid lasers.
	3. Eg: Ruby, Nd:YAG, Nd:Glass lasers
2. Electrical discharge pumping
	1. Used in gas lasers.
	2. Eg: He-Ne, CO2, Argon ion laser
3. Chemical pumping
	1. . Excitation due to chemical excitation
	2. Eg: HF, DF lasers
4. Injection current pumping
	1. Used in semiconductors
	2. Injection of current through junction causes inversion among minority charge carriers
	3. Eg: InP, GaAs.

# Laser system

1. Active medium: contains atoms to be excited
2. Optical cavity: Two mirrors for reflection and constructive interference for amplification.
3. Pumping mechanism: Used to excite atoms

## 3 level laser system

Let there be three energy levels $E_0<E_1<E_2$
1. Pumping from $E_0 \rightarrow E_2$
2. $E_2\rightarrow E_1$ metastable state
3. Population inversion is achived between $E_0$ and $E_1$
4. Lasing action $E_1\rightarrow E_0$

## 4 level laser system

Let there be four energy levels $E_0<E_1<E_2<E_3$
1. Pumping from $E_0 \rightarrow E_3$
2. Rapid decay from $E_3 \rightarrow E_2$
3. Population inversion is achived between $E_1$ and $E_2$
4. Stimulated lasing action $E_2\rightarrow E_1$
5. Gets back to the ground state $E_1\rightarrow E_0$
