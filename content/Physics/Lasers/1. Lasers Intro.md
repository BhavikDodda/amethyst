# Absorption
## Stimulated
atom: E₁→E₂ (E₂>E₁)
Rate ∝ 
* number of atoms in ground state
* density of photons
# Emission
## Spontaneous
De-excitation: E₂→E₁
Rate ∝
* number of atoms in excited state
## Stimulated
Photon of energy E₁-E₂=hν interacts with atom in E₂,
De-excitation takes place: E₂→E₁, two photons are released\
Rate ∝
* number of atoms in excited state
* density of photons
## Difference
Spontaneous | Stimulated
--- |---
Postulated by Bohr | Postulated by Einstein
No extra photons are needed | Additional photons are required
1 photon is emitted | 2 photons are emitted
Less directionality | Highly directional
Greater angular spread/divergence | Divergence is extremely small ($10^{-6}\rightarrow10^{-5}$)
Poly-chromatic | Highly monochromatic
Low intensity | High intensity
Incoherent | Highly coherent
eg: light from sodium or mercury lamp | eg: light from laser source

# Coherence
It is of two types
1. Temporal coherence: A point on a wave is coherent with another point on the same wave
2. Spatial coherence: A point on a wave is coherent with a point on another wave.

# Population Inversion
When N₂ atoms in E₂ > N₁ atoms in E₁ where E₂>E₁
Usually more atoms stay in lower energy levels so if the inverse happens, it's called a population inversion.

## Distribution
$$ N_i=N_0\cdot e^\left(-\frac{E_i}{kT}\right)$$

# Einstein coefficients
N₁,N₂ atoms in E₁,E₂ energy levels
number of photons per unit volume: n
Energy density of photons p(v) = nhv
At equilibrium upward transition = downward transition
## Upward Transition
* Stimulated absorption rate = $B_{12}N₁p(v)$
	* $B_{12}$: Einstein coefficient of stimulated absorption
## Downward Transition
* Stimulated emission rate = $B_{21}N_2p(v)$
	* $B_{21}$: Einstein coefficient of stimulated emission.
* Spontaneous emission rate = $A_{21}N_2$
	* $A_{21}$: Einstein coefficient of spontaneous emission.
## Deriving p(v)
$$
\begin{align}
B_{12}N₁p(v)=B_{21}N_2p(v)+A_{21}N_2\\
p(v)=\frac{A_{21}N_2}{B_{12}N_1-B_{21}N_2}\\
Dividing\ numerator\ and\ denominator\ by\ B_{21}N_2\\
p(v)=\frac{\frac{A_{21}N_2}{B_{21}N_2}}{\frac{B_{12}}{B_{21}}\cdot e^{-\frac{E_1-E_2}{kT}}-1}
\end{align}
$$
From [[Physics/Quantum Mechanics/ARP19 AP83/1. Blackbody Radiation#Plank's Hypothesis|Plank's Hypothesis]] we know that u(v) or p(v)=$\frac{8\pi v}{c^3}\cdot \frac{hv}{e^{\frac{hv}{kT}}-1}=\frac{8\pi hv^3/c^3}{e^{\frac{E_2-E_1}{kT}}-1}$
So, $\frac{B_{12}}{B_{21}}=1$ and $\frac{A_{21}}{B_{21}}=8\pi hv^3/c^3$
