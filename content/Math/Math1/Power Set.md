If 'A' is a finite set then [[Math/Discrete Mathematics/Intro to Set Theory#Set|set]] of all [[Math/Discrete Mathematics/Intro to Set Theory#Subset|subsets]] of A is called power set of 'A'.

### Example
A={1,2,3}
P(A)={Φ,{1},{2},{3},{1,2},{2,3},{1,3},{1,2,3}}

## Property
If B∈P(A), then B⊆A

## Number of elements in Power Set
|A|=n
|P(A)|=number of subsets of A=2ⁿ
