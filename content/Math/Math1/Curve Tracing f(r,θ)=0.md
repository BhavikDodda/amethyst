title: Curve Tracing f(r,θ)=0
---
# Symmetry
* If f(r,θ)=f(r,A-θ), then the curve is symmetric wrt θ=A/2
* If f(-r,θ)=f(r,θ), then curve is symmetric wrt pole (r=0).

# Pole
Curve passes through pole if there's a θ₀ for which r=0: i.e. if for f(0,θ₀)=0, a solution exists.

# Tangent at Pole
θ=θ₀ is tangent at pole iff f(0,θ₀)=0.

# Table
We make a table of (r,θ) in order to plot some points on the curve.

# Asymptote
If f(∞,θ₀)=0 as θ approaches θ₀, θ=θ₀ is the asymptote

# Tangent at other point
dy/dx=tan(θ₀)=$\frac{r(θ)}{r'(θ)}$
