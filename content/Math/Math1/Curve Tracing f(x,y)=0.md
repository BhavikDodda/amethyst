title: Curve Tracing f(x,y)=0
---
# Symmetry
* If f(-x,y)=f(x,y) the curve is symmetric with respect to y axis. (Even degree of x)
* If f(x,-y)=f(x,y): the curve is symmetric with respect to x axis. (Even degree of y)

# Origin
Passes through the origin if f(0,0)=0

# Tangent at origin
Equating least degree term to 0, we can get the tangent at the origin.
### dy/dx at any point on f(x,y)=0
$$
\begin{align}
f(x,y)=0\\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\cdot \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\cdot \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\\
\delta f=0=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\delta x+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\delta y\\
\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}}{\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}}
\end{align}
$$

# Intersection with coordinate axes
* f(x₀,0)=0: intersection with x-axis (y=0)
* f(0,y₀)=0: intersection with y-axis (x=0)

# Asymptotes
* To find the ones parallel to x-axis: Equate the coefficient of the term containing the **highest degree in x** to 0
* To find the ones parallel to y-axis: Equate the coefficient of the term containing the **highest degree in y** to 0

# Region of existence
Can be found by seeing the possible values of (x,y) that f(x,y)=0 satisfies.
