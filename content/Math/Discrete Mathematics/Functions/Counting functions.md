## How many functions possible?
If |A|=x and |B|=y, the number of functions f:Aâ†’B = $y^x$
Every element of A must be mapped to some element (amongst \#y) in B

## How many relations which are not functions?
If |A|=x and |B|=y,
[[Math/Discrete Mathematics/Relation/Relation#Number of Relations possible|Number of relations]]-[[#How many functions possible?|Number of functions]]
$=2^{xy}-y^x$ are the \# of relations there are, which aren't functions.
