title: Onto function
---
# (Surjection)
A [[Math/Discrete Mathematics/Functions/Functions|function]] f from set 'A' to set 'B' is onto if each and every element of B is mapped/associated to atleast one element of A
If $b\in B\ \exists a\in A\ s.t.\ f(a)=b$

### Property/Condition
* Codomain of f = B = range of f
* If f:A→B is onto, |A|=x and |B|=y, then **x≥y**
