# (Bijection)
A [[Math/Discrete Mathematics/Functions/Functions|function]] f:A→B is bijection if 'f' is:
1. [[Math/Discrete Mathematics/Functions/One to One Function|One-one]] (Injective)
2. [[Math/Discrete Mathematics/Functions/Onto function|Onto]] (Surjective)

If f:A→B is bijective, |A|=x and |B|=y, 
* By one-one: x≤y
* By onto: x≥y
* ∴ x=y

## Number of bijective functions possible
If f:A→B is one-to-one, |A|=x and |B|=y, x=y=n
number of functions possible = $n*(n-1)*(n-2)...(1)=n!$
