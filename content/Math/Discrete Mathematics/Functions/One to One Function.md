# (Injection)
A [[Math/Discrete Mathematics/Functions/Functions|function]] f from set 'A' to set 'B' is one to one if no two elements in 'A' are mapped to some element in 'B'
Image of every member of domain is distinct.
$a\ne b\Rightarrow f(a)\ne f(b)$ or $f(a)=f(b) \Rightarrow a=b$

## Property
If f:A→B is one-to-one, |A|=x and |B|=y, then **x≤y**

## Number of possible one to one functions
If f:A→B is one-to-one, |A|=x and |B|=y
possible functions: y⋅(y-1)⋅(y-2)... x number of times= y!/(y-x)! = $^{y}P_{x}$
