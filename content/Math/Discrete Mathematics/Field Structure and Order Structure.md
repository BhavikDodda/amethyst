title: Field Structure and Order Structure
---
# Field Structure
**It is an [[Math/Discrete Mathematics/Groups/Abelian Group|abelian group]] under addition with 0 as the additive identity**; the nonzero elements are an abelian group under multiplication with 1 as the multiplicative identity; and multiplication distributes over addition.

# Order Structure
A [[#Field Structure|field]] S is an ordered field if it satisfies
* Law of trichotomy
* Transitivity
* Compatibility of Order Relation with Addition&Multiplication Composition
	* a->b, a+c->b+c
	* a->b, ac->bc

> An order structure can be partially ordered or totally ordered
