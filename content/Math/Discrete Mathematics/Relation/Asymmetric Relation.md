A [[Math/Discrete Mathematics/Relation/Relation#Relation|relation]] 'R' is said to be antisymmetric if xRy then !(yRx) ∀x,y∈A
If (x,y)∈R then (y,x)∉R ∀x,y∈A

That means R contains elements of the form (c,d) but must not contain (d,c)

## Example
A={1,2,3}
R={(1,2),(1,3),(1,1)}
* R is not symmetric: does not contain (2,2),(3,3)
* R is antisymmetric: does not contain (2,1),(3,1) for the elements corresponding to (1,2),(1,3)
* R is not asymmetric: contains (1,1)

## Note
Every Asymmetric is [[Math/Discrete Mathematics/Relation/Antisymmetric Relation|Antisymmetric]].
