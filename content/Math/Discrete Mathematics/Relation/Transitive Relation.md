title: Transitive Relation
---
A [[Math/Discrete Mathematics/Relation/Relation#Relation|relation]] R on a set A is said to be transitive if xRy and yRz then xRz ∀x,y,z∈A
If (x,y)∈R & (y,z)∈R ⇒ (x,z)∈R ∀x,y,z∈A

x→y, y→z : x→z

### Example

"<=" on the set of all real numbers is a transitive relation
R={(x,y);x<=y}

If a<=b and b<=c then a<=c
