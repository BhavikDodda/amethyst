A [[Math/Discrete Mathematics/Groups/Group|group]] (G,\*) is said to be abelian if (a\*b)=(b\*a) ∀a,b∈G

### Examples
* (Z,+): yes
	* We know it's a group because it follows the properties of closure, associativity, has an identity element and inverse of a number from the set.
	* a+b=b+a ∀a,b∈Z
* (R\*,⋅): yes
	* We know it's a group
	* a\*b=b\*a ∀a,b∈R
