An [[Math/Discrete Mathematics/Groups/Algebraic Structure|algebraic structure]] (S,\*) is called a semigroup if it follows associative property
(a\*b)\*c = a\*(b\*c) ∀a,b,c∈S

### Example
* (N,+): yes
	* It has the closure property, therefore it's a algebraic structure.
	* (a+b)+c=a+(b+c) ∀a,b,c∈N: follows associative property
* (Z,\*): yes
	* It has the closure property, therefore it's a algebraic structure.
	* (a\*b)\*c=a\*(b\*c) ∀a,b,c∈Z: follows associative property
* (Z,-): no
	* It has the closure property, therefore it's a algebraic structure.
	* (a-b)-c≠a-(b-c) ∀a,b,c∈Z: **doesn't** follow associative property.
* (S={2ⁿ; n∈Z}, \*): yes
	* 2ᵃ \* 2ᵇ = 2ᵃ⁺ᵇ = 2ᶜ ∀2ᵃ,2ᵇ∈S and also 2ᶜ∈S: follows closure property.
	* (2ᵃ\*2ᵇ)\*2ᶜ=2ᵃ\*(2ᵇ\*2ᶜ) ∀a,b,c∈S: follows associative property.
