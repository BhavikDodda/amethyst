# Introduction
If the order of the differential equation is n, then n arbitrary constants will appear in the solution

Types of solutions:
* General solution: It is that solution where no. of arbitrary constants = order of differential equation
	* Also called **complete integral** or **complete primitive of the differential equation**.
* Particular solution: It is that which can be obtained from the general solution by giving particular values to the arbitrary constants.
* Singular solution: The singular solution is that solution which can't be obtained from general solution.

## Example

$$
\begin{align*}
D.E.=(y')^2+xy'=y\\
General\ solution:\ y=cx^2+c^2\\
Singular\ solution:\ 4y+x^2=0
\end{align*}
$$
