# Rank

The rank of a matrix is said to be 'r' if
* It has atleast 1 non-zero  minor of order r
* Every minor of order higher than r is 0.

# Some theorems

> [!Theorem]
> A matrix can be made row equivalent to a [[Math/Math 2/System of Linear Algebraic Equation/Echelon Form of a matrix|row echelon]] matrix  by [[Math/Math 2/System of Linear Algebraic Equation/Elementary Row operations|elementary row operations]]


> [!Theorem]
> Rank of a matrix remains invariant under [[Math/Math 2/System of Linear Algebraic Equation/Elementary Row operations|elementary row operations]]
> âˆ´ Rank of a matrix=Number of non-zero rows in [[Math/Math 2/System of Linear Algebraic Equation/Echelon Form of a matrix#Row-reduced echelon form|Row-reduced echelon form]]

# System of Linear Equations with Matrices

Given a system of linear equations we can represent it as

$$
Ax=B
$$
A: Coefficient Matrix
B: Solution Matrix

Augmented Matrix: $\bar A=(A|B)$

**Equivalent Systems**: $Ax=B$, $Cx=D$ are said to be equivalent systems if the corresponding augmented matrices (A|B), (C|D) are row equivalent

> [!Theorem]
> If Ax=B, Cx=D are equivalent systems then the solutions are equal and if one of them are inconsistent then the other is as well.

## Existence and uniqueness of the solution

* Consistent: $\text{rank}(A)=\bar A=r$
	* Unique: r=number of unknowns
	* Infinite: r< number of unknowns
* Inconsistent $\text{rank}(A)\ne \bar A$

### For a Homogeneous System

It cannot be inconsistent because $X=\vec{0}$ is always a solution, and so it can either have:
* 1 solution (zero vec.): rank(A)=number of unknowns
* infinite solutions: rank(A)< number of unknowns 

## But what is is the solution though?

### Direct Method

Gauss elimination method is used to solve a system of linear equations.

**Gauss Elimination**: It's the process of turning (A|B) into an [[Math/Math 2/System of Linear Algebraic Equation/Echelon Form of a matrix|echelon form]] (C|D) and solving the unknowns by substituting vars one by one.

**Gauss Jordan Method**: It's when it's reduced to [[Math/Math 2/System of Linear Algebraic Equation/Echelon Form of a matrix#Row-reduced echelon form|row reduced echelon form]] (C|D). No need of back-substitution to find the solution.

### Iterative Method

[Lecture 21: "Iterative Methods for Solving System of Linear Equations" - YouTube](https://youtu.be/gTOJOgp0VcE?t=1043)

Idea for deriving an iterative method:

$$
\begin{align*}
Ax=B\\
(P-N)x=B\\
\text{P is a non singular matrix}\\
Px=Nx+B\\
x^{k+1}=Gx^{k}+HB\\
G: \text{ iteration matrix }=P^{-1}N;H=P^{-1}
\end{align*}
$$
