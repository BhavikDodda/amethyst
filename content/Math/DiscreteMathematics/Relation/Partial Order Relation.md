# Partial Ordering Relation
A [[Math/DiscreteMathematics/Relation/Relation#Relation|relation]] R is said to be a partial order relation if R is:
1. [[Math/DiscreteMathematics/Relation/Reflexive Relation|Reflexive]]
2. [[Math/DiscreteMathematics/Relation/Antisymmetric Relation|Antisymmetric]]
3. [[Math/DiscreteMathematics/Relation/Transitive Relation|Transitive]]

# Partially Ordered Set (POSET)
A set 'A' with partially ordering relation 'R' defined on 'A' is called POSET.
Denoted by "\[A;R\]" 

## Example

If 'A' is any set of real numbers then \[A;<=\] is a POSET cuz it is reflexive, antisymmetric & transitive.
