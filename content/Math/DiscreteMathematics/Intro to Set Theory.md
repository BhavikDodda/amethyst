# Set
A well defined unordered collection of distinct elements is called a set.

## Null Set / Empty Set
A set with no elements. Denoted as {}=Φ

## Subset
If every element of B is also element of A then B⊆A.
**Every set is a subset of itself**: A⊆A

## Proper Subset
Any subset of A which is not a trivial subset of A (*itself*) is called proper subset of A.
B is a proper subset of A if B⊂A

## Cardinality
Total number of elements in a set.

### Property
If A⊆B and B⊆A ⇒ A=B
